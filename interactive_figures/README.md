# Interactive figures

The links below provide interactive figures using [Neuroglancer](https://neuroglancer-docs.web.app/), the [Neuroglancer precomputed volume format](https://neuroglancer-docs.web.app/datasource/precomputed/volume.html) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) as a storage backend.

This interactive figure is associated with the following figure and caption from the manuscript:

> `Fig. 1` Overview of the HiP-CT “Extremely Brilliant Brain” (EBB) and of its paired MRI. [...]
> `e`,`f`, Coronal slice of the “Extremely Brilliant Brain” dataset (`e`) and of its paired 3 T T2-weighted MRI (`f`). [...]
> The grayscale of the T2-weighted MRI was inverted to match HiP-CT contrast.  [...]

## 🖼️ [Extremely Brilliant Brain with deep brain and hippocampi](https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCL-MSM-Bio/2025-chourrout-extremely-brilliant-brain/refs/heads/main/interactive_figures/.neuroglancer_states/Extremely_Brilliant_Brain_with_deep_brain_and_hippocampi.json)

## 🖼️ [Extremely Brilliant Brain with color-coded orientations](https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCL-MSM-Bio/2025-chourrout-extremely-brilliant-brain/refs/heads/main/interactive_figures/.neuroglancer_states/Extremely_Brilliant_Brain_with_color-coded_orientations.json)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the color-coded orientations cannot be downsampled, the overlay may take some time to load. Adjusting _GPU memory limit_ and _System memory limit_ settings in Neuroglancer according to your hardware can help the data load more quickly.

This interactive figure is associated with the following figure and caption from the manuscript:

> `Fig. 5` Orientation of the white matter fibers can be retrieved with structure tensor analysis.
> `a`, Coronal section of the “Extremely Brilliant Brain”.
> `b`, Direction-encoded colors (DEC) derived from the structure tensor analysis over a 64-voxel-thick slab within a mask of white matter overlaid on the same section. [...]

This interactive figure is associated with the following **supplementary** figure and caption from the manuscript:

> `Fig. Suppl. 5` Initial output from the FastSurfer segmentation algorithm on the binned “Extremely Brilliant Brain” (EBB) dataset (isotropic voxel size of 494.08 μm).
> `a`, Coronal plane. `b`, Axial plane. `c`, Sagittal plane. `d`, 3D rendering of the labels. A few errors can be spotted within the segmentation.
> The segmentation of the left hippocampus was then manually refined, as shown in `Fig. 4`. The colormap (or lookup table) is from the FreeSurfer software suite.
